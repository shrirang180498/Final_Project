# ✅ Deliverable 3: Task Breakdown, User Stories, and Acceptance Criteria

This document outlines the actionable development tasks required to build the Emergency Alerts App. Each task includes a clearly defined user story and a detailed set of acceptance criteria, designed to guide implementation and testing.

## 🔧 Task 1: Location-Based Alert Subscription

### 🧑‍💼 User Story
*As a* user,  
*I want* to receive emergency alerts based on my current real-time location or a region I manually select,  
*So that* I stay informed about emergencies relevant to me, even when I’m on the move.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- The app must request and obtain user permission for GPS access at launch or during setup.
- Users must have the option to manually select a region if GPS access is denied.
- The system must geofence alert zones and determine whether a user is inside the affected area.
- Alerts should be automatically refreshed and updated as the user’s location changes.
- Push notifications are delivered within 3 to 5 seconds of the alert being triggered by the admin.
- If location permissions are revoked, a fallback message must be shown informing the user to enable access.

## 🔧 Task 2: Alert Creation by Verified Admins

### 🧑‍💼 User Story
*As an* authorized administrator,  
*I want* to securely log in and create emergency alerts with all necessary details (location, type, severity, message),  
*So that* the public is notified quickly and efficiently during emergencies.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Admins must authenticate using Firebase Auth and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
- Alert creation form includes fields for:
  - Alert Title
  - Type (Weather, Traffic, Crime, etc.)
  - Severity (Low, Medium, High)
  - Description
  - Affected Regions (single or multiple with map selection)
  - Duration (optional expiration timestamp)
- Preview option available before publishing.
- Upon publishing, alert is immediately visible on the map and pushed to users in the selected region.
- Alert publishing history is logged with admin ID, timestamp, and changes.

## 🔧 Task 3: Push Notification Engine Integration

### 🧑‍💻User Story
*As a* developer,  
*I want* to integrate Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for real-time push notifications,  
*So that* users are promptly notified about emergencies without opening the app.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- FCM service is initialized and configured in both the mobile frontend and backend.
- Notifications are automatically triggered when a new alert is published.
- Notification payload includes:
  - Title
  - Body (short description)
  - Alert type
  - Region identifier
  - Timestamp
- Delivery performance must be tested under load to ensure latency is < 5 seconds.
- Retry mechanism implemented to reattempt failed deliveries.
- User preferences must be respected—alerts must not be pushed if a category is disabled in their settings.
