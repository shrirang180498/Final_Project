## 🔧 Task 1: Location-Based Alert Subscription

### 🧑‍💼 User Story
*As a* user,  
*I want* to receive emergency alerts based on my current real-time location or a region I manually select,  
*So that* I stay informed about emergencies relevant to me, even when I’m on the move.

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- The app must request and obtain user permission for GPS access at launch or during setup.
- Users must have the option to manually select a region if GPS access is denied.
- The system must geofence alert zones and determine whether a user is inside the affected area.
- Alerts should be automatically refreshed and updated as the user’s location changes.
- Push notifications are delivered within 3 to 5 seconds of the alert being triggered by the admin.
- If location permissions are revoked, a fallback message must be shown informing the user to enable access.
