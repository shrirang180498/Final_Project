## üìñ Problem Statement

Many citizens do not receive critical emergency alerts in time due to fragmented notification systems, lack of personalization, and delayed delivery. Traditional systems like SMS, radio, or TV broadcasts are non-interactive, limited in reach, and not optimized for real-time user preferences.

This application aims to solve these problems by delivering:
- *Real-time alerts based on live location*
- *Push notifications for emergencies*
- *Interactive map views and historical alert tracking*
- *An intuitive mobile interface accessible to all age groups*

## üß© Project Objectives

- Create a mobile-first alert app with geolocation-based and manually filtered notifications.
- Ensure real-time delivery using Firebase Cloud Messaging.
- Enable verified authorities to issue alerts.
- Provide historical access to past incidents.
- Allow users to report nearby incidents (admin-verified).
